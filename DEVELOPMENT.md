# Development

This document helps to detail tooling that you would want to be aware of if developing this github action.

## Developing Locally

Install your dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Lint your project (we use eslint):

```shell
npm run lint
```

Format your project files (we use prettier):

```shell
npm run format
```

Build your typescript files to .js:

```shell
npm run build
```

## Committing your changes

We make use of [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to do versioning and publishing of our package.
Semantic-release is configured to require specific commit syntax (in the default case, it's the angular commit syntax). Because of this, we
use [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) to verify that your commits follow appropriate syntax and will reject them if not.

As a general rule of thumb:

1. use `feat:` for minor version changes
2. use `fix:` for patch version changes

## Auto-syncing with the base template

There is also an [auto-sync](./.github/workflows/auto-sync.yaml) workflow that we provide to give you the ability to automatically be kept up-to-date
on any boilerplate changes. This will create PRs when there is a PR with new changes to the base repo so that you can see the diff and determine how
to act. You can make use of the [templatesync.json](./templatesync.json) and [templatesync.local.json](./templatesync.local.json) files to change how
files merge together. For more information please see the [template-repo-sync-action](https://github.com/HanseltimeIndustries/template-repo-sync-action).
